A look at combinatorial optimisation methods using one of the classic problems that it is used for - placing n queens on an n x n chessboard
so that no queen can take any other. There are straightforward ways to do this systematically, but the aim here is to throw that knowlege aside
and solve it using various techniques in combinatorial optimisation.
